However, there are good ways to get a close to optimal bundle, and we will award points based off people's ideas there. This is a type of question you would usually see in an algorithms class, which is usually taken after 2 semesters of CS and focuses on these types of questions, so we don't expect anybody to solve this. Feel free to give a try though. Since it is a bonus question, we will not provide any assistance for it."
