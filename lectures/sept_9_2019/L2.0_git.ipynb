If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)so that we can write a longer message.\n",
    "3. ___BEST PRACTICES___ [Good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) start with a brief `(<50 characters)` statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence \"If applied, this commit will\" <commit message here>. If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be."
